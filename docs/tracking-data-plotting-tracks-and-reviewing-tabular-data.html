<p>This step can be particularly useful when you have not only combined data from a single species and colony, but when you have combined many datasets from many species and colonies.</p>
<p>Before you plot any data, it can be a good idea to broadly explore the data.</p>
<p>While you might know which species you tracked, and from which colonies, and from which years, it can often be worth checking over these (and other) aspects of your data.</p>
<p>Checking the data helps refresh your view on what data you have, and also helps you pick up any errors that may have arisen when inputting data.</p>

<p>From the summary output above we can see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>scientific_name: we have tracking data from one species</li>
<li>site_name: we have tracking data from one general site</li>
<li>colony_name: we have tracking data from one colony</li>
<li>year: data comes from between 2019 and 2020</li>
<li>breed_stage: all data relates to birds during the chick-rearing life-cycle stage.</li>
<li>age and sex: data is from adult birds of unknown sex</li>
<li>n_birds, n_tracks: because n_birds = n_tracks, it indicates that:
<ul>
<li>either the tracking data from each individual bird has not been separated into unique trips (in which case it needs to be), or</li>
<li>the tracking data from each individual bird is only representative of a single trip to sea (during the breeding period when birds may be exhibiting central place foraging behaviour)</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Once you have formatted your data into a standardised format and ensured that parts of your data are inputted correctly, it is also worth ensuring your data is ordered (arranged) correctly chronologically. An artifact of manipulating spatial data is that sometimes the data can become un-ordered with respect to time, or, given the way various devices interact with satellites, you can also end up with duplicated entries according to timestamps.</p>
<p>This can be a first problem, causing your track to represent unrealistic movement patterns of the animal.</p>
<p>We need to ensure our data is ordered correctly and also remove any duplicate timestamps.</p>

<p>Using the <code>leaflet</code> package in R, you can easily visualise your tracking data interactively within RStudio. Note though, if you have very large datasets, this option may not always work smoothly.</p>
<p>What should you look for when visualising the raw data?
* Are your locations in realistic places?
* Have you perhaps mixed up the latitude and longitude columns?
* Does your data cross the international date line? Do you know how to deal with this?
* Will you need to remove sections of the data that do not represent a time when the animal was tagged? (e.g. perhaps you set the device to start recording locations before deploying on the animal. So the tag might have recorded while you were travelling to the deployment location. Therefore, removing these sections of the track will facilitate your overall analysis.)</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.10</span> Review of overall plot for all data points<a href="tracking-data-plotting-tracks-and-reviewing-tabular-data.html#review-of-overall-plot-for-all-data-points" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Based on the interactive plot, you can see that generally the data looks good. Generally, all the locations are in the Adriatic Sea area (something we would anticipate based on what we know about Yelkouan Shearwaters breeding in Croatia). We can conclude the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Locations appear to be in realistic places.</li>
<li>It’s unlikely that we have mixed up the latitude and longitude columns.</li>
<li>The data does not cross the international date line.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regarding removing sections of the data that do not represent a time when the animal was tagged: Later filtering steps may remove these parts of the track if locations are near the vicinity of the colony (see details of the <code>tripSplit()</code> function). However, if there are broader location data associated with these types of locations, you will need to remove these sections of the track.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if the device remained on and you continued to receive location data while you were travelling away from a site. You might need to remove this data with some more manual data cleaning steps.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.11</span> Save all the location data as a shapefile<a href="tracking-data-plotting-tracks-and-reviewing-tabular-data.html#save-all-the-location-data-as-a-shapefile" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Visualising all the location data in R can be a simpler starting point. You may also want to save this data as a shapefile (.shp) for viewing in GIS software such as QGIS or ArcGIS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: saving all data as a single shapefile can be a memory intensive task (i.e. if you have a lot of data, then your computer might take a long time to save the file, or the file will be big and slow to work with)</p>

<p>Once you have reviewed the overall status of the tracking data you collected, it can be worth assessing the tracks of individual animals.</p>
<p>This can give you a better idea of the quality of the data for each individual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Visualising tracking data from individual animals can help you understand which data you might remove, or which data you might try and salvage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on the amount of data you have, you can often initially perform a static exploration of tracks from each individual (i.e. a simple plot of tracks from each individual), followed by an interactive exploration of tracks from all individuals, or only data from those individuals where interactive exploration is deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Below, outlines options for visualising individual animal tracks.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.14</span> When to remove or salvage data from a tracked individual(s)<a href="tracking-data-plotting-tracks-and-reviewing-tabular-data.html#when-to-remove-or-salvage-data-from-a-tracked-individuals" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>We would welcome further examples and guidance on this topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some cases, an entire track may be worth disregarding or trying to salvage. However, it often might be the case that only certain trips from the entire period an animal was tracked may be worth removing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, which data you keep or remove for a respective analysis can be somewhat subjective.</p>
<p><strong>Critically: it is important to ensure that the data you do keep / use for an analysis is suited to the type of question you may be investigating with your data</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you were just looking at any potential area an animal might visit, then you may wish to keep all your data and simply provide a descriptive summary of the data. (so long as it has been cleaned for erroneous / incorrect locations)</p></li>
<li><p>However, if you were investigating detailed movement patterns of an animal, then if you have many poor quality tracks recorded you may wish to remove these (e.g. big gaps in timestamps between consecutive data points, or many likely incomplete tracks).</p></li>
<li><p>Ultimately, it may be the case that further data collection is required depending on the type of question you wish to answer of your data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A suitably designed sampling strategy and programming of tracking devices prior to deployment will ensure that you are able to answer the best possible question(s) of your data.</p>
