<p>From the summary above, we can see that we have data for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One species</p></li>
<li><p>One colony</p></li>
<li><p>adult birds only</p></li>
<li><p>tracks from the chick-rearing period only</p></li>
<li><p>all tracked with GPS devices</p></li>
<li><p>tracked for two seasons</p></li>
</ul>
<p>[From preliminary data exploration, we decided to pool tracks from the two years given birds were utilising the same areas]</p>
<p>[Insert Martin’s new paper about sample size / years of tracking data]</p>
<p><strong>dataGroup for the tutorial is therefore defined as:</strong> Adult Puffinus yelkouan, tracked from colony Z, during the chick-rearing period.</p>

<p>Here, we visually inspect the overall data to double check it generally looks correct.</p>
<p>A reminder on initial pre-filtering which may need to happen:</p>
<p>What should you look for when visualising the raw data?
* Are your locations in realistic places?
* Have you perhaps mixed up the latitude and longitude columns?
* Does your data cross the international date line? Do you know how to deal with this?
* Will you need to remove sections of the data that do not represent a time when the animal was tagged? (e.g. perhaps you set the device to start recording locations before deploying on the animal. So the tag might have recorded while you were travelling to the deployment location. Therefore, removing these sections of the track will facilitate your overall analysis.)</p>

<p>Once you have formatted your data into a standardised format and ensured that parts of your data is inputted correctly, it is also worth ensuring your data is ordered (arranged) correctly chronologically. An artifact of manipulating spatial data is that sometimes the data can become un-ordered with respect to time, or, given the way various devices interact with satellites, you can also end up with duplicated entries according to timestamps.</p>
<p>This can be a first problem, causing your track to represent unrealistic movement patterns of the animal.</p>
<p>We need to ensure our data is ordered correctly and also remove any duplicate timestamps.</p>

<p>It’s often the case that some location points will be in artificial places (i.e. the wrong places). This can happen for many reasons.</p>
<p>To automatically remove some of these artifical locaiton points prior to analyses, one can apply a speed filter.</p>
<p>Here we use the McConnel Speed Filter.</p>

<p>So far, the following data cleaning steps have been applied:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>General review of spatial data</p></li>
<li><p>Removing - if necessary - sections of tracks when animals were not tracked but devices were recording information (example code / procedures to be provided in future versions of toolkit)</p></li>
<li><p>Arranging data chronologically and removing duplicate entries</p></li>
<li><p>Speed filter for clearly erroneous location points</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Further cleaning of data will typically be necessary for many analyses. Steps may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Removing data with too few location points</p></li>
<li><p>Reviewing the sampling frequency of data (i.e. what frequncy you set your devices to record at versus what they actually recorded at)</p></li>
<li><p>Interpolating data to generate tracking information that approximates an even sampling interval</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When to clean data with respect to the steps above may depend on the type of animal you tracked.</p>

<p>If you have been tracking central place foraging animals, especially with modern tracking devices, it’s likely that you will have many trips recorded from an individual that was tracked.</p>
<p><strong>Defining trips:</strong> For the purpose of analysing central place foraging data with track2kba, we consider a unique trip to be the period of time from when an animal departs its colony (or particular nest), to the moment it returns to the colony (or particular nest).</p>
<p>Therefore, if we have tracking information from individuals over sufficient time period, it’s likely you will have recorded information about multiple trips.</p>
<p>We need to split the information into unique trips.</p>
<p>Functions in the track2kba R package can help us do this.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning-for-cpf-seabirds-nesting-habitat-considerations" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="29.13.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">29.13.2</span> Data cleaning for CPF seabirds: Nesting habitat considerations<a href="track2kba---central-place-foragers-clean-and-summarise-data-for-analysis.html#data-cleaning-for-cpf-seabirds-nesting-habitat-considerations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>For CPF species that nest in burrows, forests, or other locations where satellite signals may become interrupted for extend periods of time, it can be worth first splitting the overall tracking information into individual trips before filtering or cleaning data further according to number of locations (n_locs) or recorded sampling frequency.</p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>EXAMPLE DATA CONSIDERATIONS (Burrow nesting species): Puffinus yelkouan is a burrow nesting species. Therefore, we expect to have long gaps in the tracking information while the birds are sitting on nests (because satellite signals with the tracking device will be interuppted). For this reason, we will first split the tracking information into individual trips, and then apply further filters. Otherwise, it may appear that there are artificially large gaps in your tracking data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have tracking information from a species where satellite signal is unlikely to be interuppted from permanent features such as burrows or trees, it may be suitable to filter your data further before splitting tracks into individual trips because data is unlikely to be as biased by the presence of permanent physical features.</p>

<p>Splitting tracks into trips can be achieved with the <code>tripSplit()</code> function within track2kba.</p>
<p>Suitable parameters must first be applied / considered.</p>
<p><strong>What does tripSplit() do:</strong> See the track2kba manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>When not to apply tripSplit():</strong> If your data does not relate to a central place forager (CPF), OR
a time when an animal may be exhibiting central place foraging behaviours, then applying tripSplit will not be appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>How tripSplit() helps:</strong> This step is often very useful to help automate the removal of location points
on land, or near the vicinty of a colony. We don’t want these extra points to bias our interpretation of the data.</p>
<p><strong>General considerations when applying tripSplit():</strong> The user must define ecologically sensible parameters to help automate the tripSplitting process.</p>

<p>First define a colony of origin for each individual animal tracked.</p>
<p>This can be achieved in several ways.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you must take scale into account; with respect to species movement, and quality of data from a given device.</p>

<p>[“NOTE: the messages that may relate to ‘track …. does not return to the colony’,
is actually referring to the individual trips from each animal tracked. The code
for track2KBA package needs to be revised to display an ’_’ between the track ID
and the individual trip ID. So instead of reading something like 693041, it should
read 69304_1, to better refer to trip 1 of track 69304.”]</p>

<p>In the example above, we specified <code>rmNonTrip = F</code> so as not remove any points not deemed as associated with a trip. I.e. the points typically lying within the <code>innerBuff</code> distance and for those where the animal traveled for less than <code>duration</code> specified,</p>
<p>Let’s review the general points we are not considering as part of trips.</p>
<p>Split the locations into points to keep and those that will be removed (i.e. the points not associated with a trip) for visual plot of the tracks using leaflet package in R.</p>
<p>Note: when specifying <code>rmNonTrip = F</code>, location points are assigned under the column <strong>Return</strong> as either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yes (part of trip that animal returns to colony),</p></li>
<li><p>No (part of a trip where animal does not return to colony),</p></li>
<li><p>or Blank (location point that would be removed)</p></li>

<p>Essentially, we are using a function that helps us bulk clean tracking data. The goal is to assign individual trips to multiple animals that have been tracked, and doing this in an automated way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go back and change <code>innerBuff</code> and <code>duration</code> parameters in particular, and recreate the plot above showing the points not associated with a trip. See how changing the arguments impacts the likely data that will be removed for the analysis. You only want to remove (i.e. “clean up”) the points that are most likely not associated with a trip.</p>

<p>If, after reviewing the simplified plots of individual trips for each tracked animal using the <code>mapTrip()</code> function you are not satisfied, then you should explore the relative data further.</p>
<p>One way of exploring the trips outputted for individually tracked animals would be to rapidly review summary plots for each trip, showing start, journey, and end points, where the point locations are also joined together with a line. Consider the code in the chapter <em>Tracking data: Plotting tracks and reviewing tabular data</em></p>

<p>Keeping points associated with complete trips only is the approach considered in the <code>track2KBA</code> online tutorial. But you may want to explore which trips you are keeping or not.</p>
<p>There are no definitive rules about what counts as a track good enough, or too bad, for an analysis. Users will need to consider the quality of the data obtained in relation to the species that was tracked and the key question they are exploring.</p>
<p>Users may wish to consider if too many individual trips have been removed. i.e. if you tracked 30 birds and you estimated to have approximately 3 trips recorded per bird, then you would have a total of 90 trips. But it’s likely that on some trips, that not the entire trip was recorded (for multiple reasons). Therefore, you might expect to rather have about 83 trips recorded across all birds because for 7 trips data might not have indicated birds returned to the colony. If you had a very high proportion of trips that did not return to the colony, then it’s likely that you have defined the parameters incorrectly for tripSplit() and you
should reconsider better ecologically based estimates for these parameters. There is of course the chance that there are other issues (i.e. poor quality data obtained given device functionality) with your data which would warrant more detailed exploration.</p>

<p>If you want to explore further the trips that were not considered to have returned, then use the object above, <code>trips.return.no</code>, to investigate the individual trips further. E.g. through individual plotting.</p>
<p>For our example, we have 325 complete trips and 19 incomplete trips; a very small proportion of incomplete trips. We, therefore, deem our choice of input parameters as ecologically sensible for the tripSplit() function and use only the complete trips for further analyses.</p>

<p><strong>Key considerations related to identifying IBAs / KBAs:</strong> when identifying an IBA or KBA for seabirds using the track2KBA protocol, you effectively need information about the source population (typically the colony) and distribution data (tracking data). This means that not only can you identify a pelagic site from tracking data, but you can also consider an IBA/KBA for the colony itself and a possible at-sea buffer (seaward extension) around the colony.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because you should typically consider identifying the seaward extension around the colony in addition to any potential pelagic / offshore sites supported by the tracking data, you can remove location points from the data within a suitable buffer distance (typically the inner buffer distance used in the <code>tripSplit()</code> function.</p>

<p>It is worth considering the total number of location points contributing to each trip after splitting tracks from animals. Even if you are not splitting tracks into trips, using location data from animals where you have very few data points may bias your results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommendation for the track2kba analytical approach is to use data with at least &gt;5 location points</p>

<p>To implement track2KBA fully, you need data approximating an even sampling interval i.e. location points must be regularly spaced in time.</p>
<p>You must first determine how “gappy” the tracking data is (time intervals between location data)</p>
<p>This is an important step for almost all tracking data analyses.</p>
<p>If your data is not filtered / cleaned correctly, your ultimate results may be spurious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider whether the sampling interval of your tracking data is appropriate
for formally running the track2KBA functions. Remember, the time differences
between each of your location points should be equal (or close enough to equal)
across all location points and individuals tracked. If the time difference
between location points is not equal, the outputs you generate from track2KBA
will not be valid because the underlying kernel density analysis implemented
within the track2KBA functions will be invalid
(because you need points evenly spaced in time for this analysis to be valid).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, review the summary of your recorded sampling interval data:</p>

<p>If you have trips where the maximum time gap in seconds (<code>max_timegap_secs</code>) is
extremely different to the <em>median of median time gaps</em> in minutes, then it’s likely you need to consider why this is the case for those trips.
- Did you specify tripSplit parameters incorrectly?
- Does the data require further cleaning in some other way?
- What else to consider</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: you should be aware of what the original pre-programmed sampling interval was. How do your results compare to this interval?</p>

<p>If you have gaps between time stamps in your tracking data, you need to fill these gaps for the purpose of the track2KBA protocol. It’s likely you will need to do this for many other tracking data analyses.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two key ways to fill the gaps in your tracking data, a process known as interpolation.</p>
<p>These two ways include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Simpler linear interpolation</p></li>
<li><p>More advanced interpolation options that try account for where the animal could have moved (e.g. CRAWL)</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically, for flying seabirds, where gaps in tracking data while birds at sea are less likely because birds do not typically dive underwater for durations as long as non-flying seabirds, linear interpolation should serve as a suitable starting point.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More advanced interpolation methods may be required for diving seabirds, or other diving marine predators.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>See the appendix which offers an introduction to other available interpolation methods</strong></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">29.21.1</span> Interpolating data: using only at-sea locations<a href="track2kba---central-place-foragers-clean-and-summarise-data-for-analysis.html#interpolating-data-using-only-at-sea-locations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>REMINDER: Removing trip start and end points near the colony for the interpolation (as completed above), especially if using more advanced methods like CRAWL, can support filtering only points at sea when you estimate birds should be moving, as opposed to trying to deal with sections of trips when the bird is actually stationary on land.</p>
<p>Other methods do support interpolation of data when animals are on land. These are not yet detailed in the toolkit.</p>

<p>Reminder: The average sampling interval of all data (i.e. the median of median time gaps in minutes) was 40.0333333333 minutes.</p>
<p>Set your interpolation interval accordingly. You can use these results and knowledge of your programmed sampling interval.</p>
<p>Here we set the interpolation interval in minutes.</p>
